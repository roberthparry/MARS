# Benchmarks

MARS includes a small set of focused benchmark binaries for symbolic,
integrator-heavy, and arithmetic-core paths.

The sample results in this document were collected on an
`Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz` laptop, with `4` logical CPUs
(`2` cores, `2` threads per core). Treat them as illustrative rather than as a
strict cross-machine baseline.

## Running Benchmarks

From the repository root:

```sh
make bench_integrator
make bench_matrix_expr
make bench_number_maths
make bench_number_scope
make bench_qfloat_gamma_maths
make bench_qcomplex_maths
```

As with the test suites, prefer running benchmarks sequentially for now. The
current codebase and build products are not yet fully thread-safe for
overlapping runs.

To refresh the benchmark tables in the numeric docs from the release benches,
run:

```sh
tools/render/bench-docs/update_bench_docs.sh
```

To refresh only a subset of those docs, pass one or more target names:

```sh
tools/render/bench-docs/update_bench_docs.sh qfloat qcomplex
```

## Output Units

Current benchmark output reports robust per-call timing estimates rather than a
single average:

- plain-text scalar benches print the sample median, MAD, and a bootstrap 95%
  confidence interval
- markdown tables print the median in a compact display unit, keeping `1dp` in
  the base unit and promoting to the next unit with `3dp` once the value
  reaches `1000`

## Integrator Benchmark

`bench_integrator` measures symbolic fast paths in the adaptive integrator.

It reports:

- matched symbolic shortcut families
- nearby fallback cases that look similar but miss the exact matcher path
- average time per integral call
- interval count used on the warmup run

Sample output:

```text
iters=10

Matched shortcut families
affine_exp             intervals=1    avg_µs=   218.240 avg_ms=     0.218
affine_square          intervals=1    avg_µs=   233.723 avg_ms=     0.234
affine_quartic         intervals=1    avg_µs=    61.877 avg_ms=     0.062
affine_times_exp       intervals=1    avg_µs=    77.678 avg_ms=     0.078
affine_cube_exp        intervals=1    avg_µs=    87.244 avg_ms=     0.087
affine_times_sin       intervals=1    avg_µs=    82.199 avg_ms=     0.082
affine_cube_sin        intervals=1    avg_µs=   106.263 avg_ms=     0.106
affine_times_sinh      intervals=1    avg_µs=   147.103 avg_ms=     0.147
affine_cube_sinh       intervals=1    avg_µs=   123.834 avg_ms=     0.124

Near misses (generic path)
near_miss_square       intervals=1    avg_µs=  1647.171 avg_ms=     1.647
near_miss_quartic      intervals=1    avg_µs= 17767.062 avg_ms=    17.767
near_miss_exp          intervals=2    avg_µs= 49084.036 avg_ms=    49.084
near_miss_sin          intervals=2    avg_µs= 40497.935 avg_ms=    40.498
near_miss_sinh         intervals=2    avg_µs= 32043.325 avg_ms=    32.043
```

The useful comparison is usually “matched case versus near miss,” since that
shows how much work the symbolic shortcut is saving.

## Symbolic Matrix Benchmark

`bench_matrix_expr` measures dense symbolic `MAT_TYPE_EXPR` linear algebra on
representative exact cases.

It currently covers:

- dense symbolic solve on `3x3` and `6x6` systems
- dense symbolic inverse on `4x4` and `6x6` systems

Sample output:

```text
iters=3

Symbolic expr solve
solve_dense3x3_rhs2      avg_µs=  6000.421 avg_ms=     6.000
solve_dense6x6_rhs2      avg_µs=566623.682 avg_ms=   566.624

Symbolic expr inverse
inverse_dense4x4         avg_µs= 40635.324 avg_ms=    40.635
inverse_dense6x6         avg_µs=876341.423 avg_ms=   876.341
```

These numbers are intended as a rough baseline for the current
fraction-free symbolic elimination path rather than as a strict performance
contract.

## Numeric Benchmarks

### `number`

Available benchmark target:

```sh
make bench_number_maths
```

There is also a scope-focused benchmark target:

```sh
make bench_number_scope
```

This benchmark exercises the generic `number_t` API, including:

- elementary functions such as `exp`, `ln`, `lg`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `atan`,
  `sinh`, `tanh`, and `pow`
- paired output functions such as `sincos` and `sinhcosh`
- special functions such as `gamma`, `lgamma`, `digamma`, `trigamma`,
  `tetragamma`, `erf`, `erfc`, `gammainv`, `lambert_w0`, `lambert_wm1`,
  `beta`, `logbeta`, `binomial`, `normal_pdf`, `normal_cdf`, `Ei`, and `E1`
- named constants such as `pi`, `e`, and Euler-Mascheroni

Because `number_t` accepts exact integer and rational inputs as well as
floating-point values, this benchmark is useful for measuring the combined cost
of generic promotion, backend dispatch, and the underlying maths
implementation.

The scope benchmark focuses specifically on temporary-lifetime management. It
compares:

- fully manual ownership with explicit `num_destroy(...)`
- broad whole-scope temporary accumulation
- the preferred pattern of scoped short-lived intermediates plus an ordinary
  owned rolling result

Current sample timings on the benchmark machine for that scope benchmark:

```text
real chain               manual= 129.082 ms  scoped= 125.772 ms  ratio= 1.026x
real scoped+roll         manual= 129.082 ms  scoped= 110.554 ms  ratio= 1.168x
complex chain            manual= 221.584 ms  scoped= 225.807 ms  ratio= 0.981x
complex scoped+roll      manual= 221.584 ms  scoped= 198.489 ms  ratio= 1.116x
```

Use `MARS_BENCH_FORMAT=md` with benchmark binaries when you want docs-ready
tables instead of the ordinary line-by-line terminal output.

### `qfloat`

Available benchmark target:

```sh
make bench_qfloat_gamma_maths
```

This benchmark currently covers a broader `qfloat` maths slice:

- `qf_exp(1)` and `qf_log(10)`
- `qf_erf(0.5)` and `qf_erfc(0.5)`
- `qf_gamma`, `qf_lgamma`, `qf_digamma`, `qf_trigamma`, and `qf_tetragamma`
- `qf_gammainv`
- `qf_lambert_w0` and `qf_lambert_wm1`
- `qf_Ei` and `qf_E1`
- `qf_beta` and `qf_logbeta`

Current sample timings with `MARS_BENCH_SCALE=5` on the benchmark machine:

```text
exp_1                 bits=256  avg_µs=   1.370 avg_ms=     0.001
log_10                bits=256  avg_µs=   2.471 avg_ms=     0.002
gamma_2_3             bits=256  avg_µs=   1.246 avg_ms=     0.001
lgamma_2_3            bits=256  avg_µs=   3.797 avg_ms=     0.004
gammainv_9_5          bits=256  avg_µs=  82.548 avg_ms=     0.083
lambert_wm1_-0_1      bits=256  avg_µs=  58.889 avg_ms=     0.059
logbeta_2_3_4_5       bits=256  avg_µs=  17.206 avg_ms=     0.017
```

One implementation note matters here: on the current x86_64 machine, `qfloat`
release tests stay correct under `-O2` and `-O2 -flto`, but `-march=native
-mtune=native` caused `Ei`/`E1` regressions. Because of that, the user-facing
`qfloat` release targets are built with a safer release profile than the
project-wide native-tuned default.

### `qcomplex`

Available benchmark target:

```sh
make bench_qcomplex_maths
```

This benchmark covers a representative complex-valued slice:

- `qc_exp(1+i)` and `qc_log(1+i)`
- `qc_erf(0.5+0.5i)` and `qc_erfc(0.5+0.5i)`
- complex gamma-family calls including `qc_gamma`, `qc_lgamma`, `qc_digamma`,
  `qc_trigamma`, and `qc_tetragamma`
- real and genuinely complex `qc_gammainv` cases
- `qc_productlog` and `qc_lambert_wm1`
- `qc_Ei`, `qc_E1`, `qc_beta`, and `qc_logbeta`

Current sample timings on the benchmark machine:
